  <div class="container my-5">
    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Our History</h2>
    <p>
      The idea of EDEVELOPER was born during the first semester of the first year of college by <strong>Bhuvam
        Gautam</strong>. Initially, it began as a personal endeavor to learn coding and understand the fundamentals of
      development. The journey started with learning the basics, followed by applying the knowledge to real-world
      projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2024, Bhuvam Gautam decided to turn this passion into a platform that could help others. He dedicated himself
      to creating a space where beginners could find structured resources, interactive tools, and a supportive
      community. His love for coding and problem-solving, combined with a keen interest in technology, drove the
      development of EDEVELOPER.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, EDEVELOPER stands as a testament to the belief that anyone can learn and excel in development with the
      right guidance and resources. It continues to inspire and empower developers worldwide.
